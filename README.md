My goal is to complete 2-3 LeetCode challenges a day 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Day 1: running sums, pivot index, is_ismorphic 

Problem 1: Given an array nums. We define a running sum of an array as runningSum[i] = sum(nums[0]â€¦nums[i]).
           Return the running sum of nums.

Problem 2: Given an array of integers nums, calculate the pivot index of this array.
           The pivot index is the index where the sum of all the numbers strictly to the left of the index is equal to the sum of all the numbers strictly to the index's right.
           If the index is on the left edge of the array, then the left sum is 0 because there are no elements to the left. This also applies to the right edge of the array.
           Return the leftmost pivot index. If no such index exists, return -1.

Problem 3: Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic.
           Two strings s and t are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.
           All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character, but a character may map to itself.

Day 2: Is Subsequence, Merge Two Sorted Lists

Problem 1: Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise.
           A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).

Problem 2: You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists list1 and list2.
           Merge the two lists in a one sorted list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.
           Return the head of the merged linked list.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Day 3: Reverse Linked List, Middle of the Linked List

Problem 1: Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return the reversed list.

Problem 2: Given the head of a singly linked list, return the middle node of the linked list.
           If there are two middle nodes, return the second middle node.

Day 4:
